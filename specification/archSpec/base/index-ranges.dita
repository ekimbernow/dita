              Robert and I think that they were authored in order to
              communicate that if you want a range to be specified for a
              secondary entry, it has to be done like this:</p>
            <codeblock>&lt;indexterm>Potato
  &lt;indexterm start="yellow">Yellow potatoes&lt;/indexterm>
&lt;/indexterm>

&lt;indexterm>Potato
  &lt;indexterm end="yellow"/>

                <li>When index ranges with the same identifier overlap, <ph
            rev="review-1">the effective range is determined by matching
            the earliest <ph rev="review-chenier">start-of-range</ph>
            element from the set of overlapping ranges with the latest <ph
              rev="review-chenier">end-of-range element</ph> from the set
            of overlapping ranges.</ph></li>
        <li rev="review-chenier">An unmatched start-of-range element is
